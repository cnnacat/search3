# search3

my third attempt at making a dumb stupid search thing for windows.<br>
this thing is barely tested for any edge cases, but if you use it AS INTENDED then it should be fine.

put this thing together in like, 3-5 hours tho so i guess i did learn a lot from my previous attempts


# Design

Starts searching in its immediate directory and all child directories, unless otherwise specified with the --directory / -D CLI argument.

Spits out any PERFECT matches and any SIMILAR matches, along with the directory location of each file relative to the starting search directory. Will notify if nothing is found.


# Project specifications

- Uses a FILO linked list
- idk i just experimented with a bunch of new functions i've never used before


# How to run

Compile with cmake or download the ZIP/Rar file. 

NOTE!!: If you wish to compile natively, you must use a toolchain that is compatible with POSIX stuff, because it uses POSIX standard stuff. Also it should be obvious that this can't be compiled on a non-Windows OS because it uses the Windows API. This script was developed with the UCRT64 toolchain.  
End users should just download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/cnnacat/search3/releases).


Run in Windows CMD, cd'd into the executable's parent directory.

Example usage:
```bash
search3 --target=file_name --directory=directory_path
```
--target is a required argument.
--directory is an optional argument.

NOTE!: This program cannot run without its DLL due to the licensing of [getopt-win](https://github.com/ludvikjerabek/getopt-win?tab=LGPL-3.0-1-ov-file) by ludvikjerabek. If you want to search a directory other than the one the executable is in, you have to move BOTH the executable and the DLL into the desired directory, or use the preferred method of just using --directory / -D to specify directory.
